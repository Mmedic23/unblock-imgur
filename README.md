# unblock-imgur

*Some sources (the 0imgur redirect extension for Mozilla) claim that 0imgur is attempting to use your PC for mining, therefore use of this extension is not recommended at all.*

Loads Imgur content from the 0imgur mirror with basic functionality

I don't even know javascript I just edited the parts of the source I understood to redirect to 0imgur instead of load a DDG proxy.

I have no idea what content.js does, but the extension can't exists without it. Maybe I'll learn Chrome Extension Development/Javascript one day and delete this repo.
